# React & WebAssembly (using Rust)

React app that calculates nth Fibonacci number. The calculation is done using the web assembly and written in Rust. The javascript binding is implemented using the wasm bingen (https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen).

## How this is done?
Required installations: Node, Rust, wasm-pack (https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack)

- Create a react app
```
npx create-react-app your_app
```
- Run your react app and check that everything is ok.
```
cd your_app
npm start
```
- Create WebAssembly library into yuor react app. 
```
cargo new wasm-lib --lib
```
- Now, you are ready to implement your Rust function into the lib.rs file (wasm-lib) folder. Check the example function that 
calculates nth fibonacci number from the lir.rs file. When you are done, build your library using the wasm-pack. Next command creates the files neccessary for JavaScript interoperability and for publishing a package to npm. 
```
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg
```
- Now, you should have package.json file in your wasm-lib folder. Next, install your wasm package into the react app. 
````
 npm install ./wasm-lib/pkg
```
- Finally, import your function to react component and you are ready to use it. Check the example from App.js file


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
